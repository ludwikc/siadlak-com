# Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) Documentation

This document confirms the implementation of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for data transfers to US-based services used by siadlak.com, in compliance with GDPR requirements following the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the Schrems II decision.

## Overview

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission that enable the lawful transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to third countries, including the United States, which have not been deemed to provide adequate protection for personal data.

## Implementation Status

The following US-based services used by siadlak.com are covered by SCCs:

| Service | Purpose | Data Processed | SCC Implementation Date |
|---------|---------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Google Analytics 4 | Analytics | Usage data, IP addresses (anonymized) | April 13, 2025 |
| Google Tag Manager | Tag management | No personal data stored | April 13, 2025 |
| Plausible Analytics | Privacy-friendly analytics | Aggregated usage data | April 13, 2025 |
| Salesforce | CRM | Contact information, interaction history | April 13, 2025 |
| Calendly | Appointment scheduling | Name, email, appointment preferences | April 13, 2025 |
| MailerLite | Email marketing | Email addresses, subscription preferences | April 13, 2025 |
| Discord OAuth | Authentication | Authentication tokens | April 13, 2025 |

## Supplementary Measures

In addition to implementing SCCs, the following supplementary measures have been implemented to enhance data protection:

1. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and transferred to US-based services.
2. **Encryption**: All data transfers occur over encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).
3. **IP Anonymization**: IP addresses are anonymized before being sent to analytics services.
4. **Consent Management**: No personal data is transferred to US-based services without explicit user consent.
5. **Regular Audits**: Regular audits of data flows to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.

## Risk Assessment

A thorough risk assessment has been conducted for each US-based service to evaluate:

1. The nature of the data being transferred
2. The likelihood of public authority access to the data
3. The effectiveness of legal remedies available to data subjects

Based on this assessment, the implemented SCCs combined with the supplementary measures provide sufficient safeguards for the transfer of personal data to these US-based services.

## Documentation and Records

Copies of the executed SCCs are maintained and available upon request to supervisory authorities. The Data Protection Officer (DPO) maintains records of all international data transfers and the corresponding legal bases.

## Review Process

This documentation and the implemented SCCs are reviewed annually or whenever there are significant changes to:

1. The services used
2. The nature of the data transferred
3. The legal framework governing international data transfers
4. The risk assessment of the third countries involved

Last review date: April 13, 2025
